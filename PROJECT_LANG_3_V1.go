The 2nd project language file is written in Java, as the API Samsung writes is in Java (as far as I know) The 3rd language is written in Go, as I want this feature to Go away. This is the third project language file, and it is written in Go (2008 Google language, instead of the 2004 Francis McCabe language, I chose not to use it this time)
